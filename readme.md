website for Semm to store his notes and alleviate his anxiety

recently added:
- adjustable theme (light/dark mode, remembers preference with localhost cookie)
- ability to download files
- when new webpage is made for a document, index.php can be copied into new directory with no changes
- basic search function (each page must be manually added, current version is mainly visual mockup)
- adjustable font adjusts font and element sizes dynamically and remembers preference with localhost cookie
- page templates (current have templates for "list" pages (lists of folders and files) and "document" pages (pages for displaying and downloading individual documents))
- automatic creation of "document" pages upon upload

in progress:
- multiple file uploads (currently uploads are only possible one at a time but we should be able to upload an entire list of files and have them all processed properly)
- folder page creation (button next to Folders title just like file upload will be a button next to Files title)
- search bar functionality
  - search text on page as well as page titles
  - automatically add new pages to search (search should index entire site minus blacklist)

future additions:
- ability to upload and move files and create new folders (should this be available to signed in users? could create system so select people have edit access)
- way to clean up formatting of existing .doxc and .doc files en masse. may require large brute force effort (so far, documents are being manually added, see https://semm.emrysmayell.com/Philosophy/files/Existentialism for examples
