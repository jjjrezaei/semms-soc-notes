website for Semm to store his notes and alleviate his anxiety

recently added:
- adjustable theme (light/dark mode, remembers preference with localhost cookie)
- ability to download files
- when new webpage is made for a document, index.php can be copied into new directory with no changes
- basic search function (each page must be manually added, current version is mainly visual mockup)

in progress:
- search bar functionality
  - search text on page as well as page titles
  - automatically add new pages to search (search should index entire site minus blacklist)
- adjustable font (currently adjusts sizes correctly and remembers preference with localhost cookie but needs formatting adjustments for text sizes over 20px)

future additions:
- ability to upload and move files and create new folders (should this be available to signed in users? could create system so select people have edit access)
- self organizing files (all page titles and assets should be stored in variables so files can be uploaded and a single name and location can be chosen by user, the rest automated)
- way to clean up formatting of existing .doxc and .doc files en masse. may require large brute force effort (so far, documents are being manually added, see https://semm.emrysmayell.com/Philosophy/ for exmaples
